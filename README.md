### Hi! welcome to my repository.

Do pip install requirements to get started.

To make your own database use [mysql database scripts] (https://github.com/himalaya-singh-sheoran/pyqt5_employee_management_sys/tree/master/mysql%20database%20scripts) for reference.

To run the application use :
```python
python emp_login.py
```
